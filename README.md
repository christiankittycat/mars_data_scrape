# mars_data_scrape

This project focuses on analyzing the weather data collected by NASAâ€™s Curiosity rover on Mars. The primary objective is to understand Martian weather patterns by scraping data from a provided website and performing various analyses using Python. The dataset includes information on terrestrial dates, Martian sols, solar longitude, Martian months, minimum daily temperatures, and atmospheric pressure. We used web scraping techniques with the Splinter and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract this data, then organized it into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. After converting the necessary columns to appropriate data types, we performed statistical analysis and visualization to identify trends in the data.

Our analysis included calculating the average minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure for each Martian month. We identified the coldest and warmest months based on average minimum temperatures and the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressures. Additionally, we estimated the length of a Martian year in Earth days by analyzing the periodic temperature cycles. This involved plotting the daily minimum temperature over time and identifying peaks in the data to determine the average period between them. The results provided valuable insights into Martian weather patterns, helping us understand the climate conditions Curiosity experiences. All the processed data was saved to a CSV file for further use and reference.
